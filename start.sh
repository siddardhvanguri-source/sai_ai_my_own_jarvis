# Starts the agent's pieces, in the right order:
#   ai-visualizer (the face, opens in your browser)
#   barehands     (the hands, URL printed; open it when you want the board)
#   backtalk      (the voice, runs in this terminal; Ctrl-C stops EVERYTHING)
# Pieces you didn't install are skipped automatically.

#   ./start.sh          everything installed
#   ./start.sh voice    the voice and the face (no hands)
#   ./start.sh hands    the voice and the hands board (no face)

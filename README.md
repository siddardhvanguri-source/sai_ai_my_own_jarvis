# Sai AI - My Own Jarvis 🤖✨

An omnipresent, personal full-stack AI assistant with memory, voice, visual face, and gesture controls integrated into the Windows desktop environment.

---

## 🚀 Overview & What We Have Done

This repository contains the complete codebase, configuration, tools, and launcher scripts for **Sai** — a personalized AI desktop assistant ("My Own Jarvis").

### Key Milestones & Accomplishments:

1. **Custom Assistant Identity & Boot Engine (`Sai`)**:
   - Configured custom identity with mandate for proactive assistance, reliability, and strategic partnership.
   - Pinned system boot configurations (`CLAUDE.md`) linking memory vaults, rules, and startup routines.

2. **Full-Stack Sensory & Interaction Suite**:
   - 🧠 **Memory Vault**: Persistent memory integration via Obsidian/Markdown text vault (`jarvis-vault`), preserving cross-session context, daily notes, and priorities.
   - 🎙️ **Voice & Ear (`backtalk`)**: Push-to-talk voice interface with ultra-low latency real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech feedback.
   - 🎭 **Visual Face (`ai-visualizer`)**: Dynamic full-screen visualizer displaying idle, listening, thinking, and speaking states in real-time.
   - ✋ **Webcam Gesture Control (`barehands`)**: Computer vision-enabled board interface to interact with notes, cards, and images using hand tracking.

3. **Skills & UI Capabilities**:
   - Added agent skills including `find-ui-templates` and `kokonut-ui` component library integration.

4. **Desktop Automation & Startup Scripts**:
   - Configured one-click desktop launchers (`start.bat`, `start.sh`, background VBS launcher) for seamless agent startup on Windows.

5. **Version Control & GitHub Sync**:
   - Initialized Git repository tracking all skills, workflows, configuration, and documentation.
   - Synchronized and published all assets to [sai_ai_my_own_jarvis](https://github.com/siddardhvanguri-source/sai_ai_my_own_jarvis).

Every piece is optional. The wizard asks which ones you want and explains each in plain English before you decide.

## Install

You need [Claude Code](https://jaredrhod.com/start) with a Claude subscription. Mac and Linux also use git (macOS offers to install it the first time you use it). Windows needs nothing else: the installer sets up git for you during setup. Then one paste into your terminal.

Mac and Linux:

```
mkdir -p ~/my-agent && cd ~/my-agent && git clone https://github.com/jaredrhod/fullstack-agent && cd fullstack-agent && claude "set me up"
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```
$d="$env:USERPROFILE\.local\bin"; if (Test-Path "$d\claude.exe") { $env:Path="$d;$env:Path" }; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $HOME\my-agent | Out-Null; cd $HOME\my-agent; if (-not (Test-Path fullstack-agent\fullstack-agent.md)) { Invoke-WebRequest https://github.com/jaredrhod/fullstack-agent/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -OutFile fsa.zip; Expand-Archive fsa.zip . -Force; New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path fullstack-agent | Out-Null; Get-ChildItem fullstack-agent-main -Force | Copy-Item -Destination fullstack-agent -Recurse -Force; Remove-Item fullstack-agent-main -Recurse -Force; Remove-Item fsa.zip }; cd fullstack-agent; if (Get-Command claude -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) { claude "set me up" } else { Write-Output "Claude Code is not installed yet. Install it first at https://jaredrhod.com/start then paste this again." }
```

(The Windows command downloads the toolbox as a zip on purpose, so it works on a machine with no git installed. The installer sets up git for you during setup. Safe to paste as many times as you like: it skips the download when the toolbox is already there, and if an earlier attempt died partway and left a half-finished folder, it downloads again and finishes the job rather than assuming it was already done. If it tells you Claude Code is not installed yet, do the [start page](https://jaredrhod.com/start) first. Heads up for that step on Windows: the Claude Code installer downloads about 330 MB and prints nothing at all while it does, so leave that window alone until it says Installation complete.)

Claude Code opens with the installer already talking to you. (The agent lives in a folder right in your home directory on purpose: on Macs, things that run in the background out of Documents get silently blocked by the system.) Everything after that is a conversation: it asks for your agent's name and personality (or hands you mine, Jarvis, ready to use), which pieces you want, and where your notes live. It does the installing, the configuring, and the wiring itself.

## Already built some of this?

Then you're exactly who this was designed around. If you set up a memory vault, a voice system, or a visualizer before, including the ones my old prompts had your AI hand-build, the wizard adopts before it installs:

- **Your agent's identity and your vault are yours.** Found, kept, never rebuilt, never moved. No questions you already answered.
- **Hand-built voice lines and visualizers get honestly replaced**, because these repos carry a year of fixes and keep improving with a `git pull`, while a hand-built version is frozen the day it was written. Your old build stays on disk, untouched. Nothing you made is ever deleted.
- **Except your visualizer scene, which gets promoted.** If your AI built you a custom scene back then, the wizard copies it into the visualizer's gallery as your own face, sitting right beside mine.

## After setup

- **Use your agent:** the wizard leaves three shortcuts on your Desktop, named after your agent. **Chat** opens a typed session, terminal only. **Talk** starts the voice and the face. **Barehands** starts the voice and the hands board (the board is the screen in that mode). Double-click the mood you want; Ctrl-C in the window stops it. (They just run `fullstack-agent/start.sh`, or `start.bat` on Windows, if you ever prefer the terminal.)
- **Something broken or confusing? Ask your agent to fix it.** Seriously. Open the chat and describe the problem. Every repo here ships a troubleshooting guide written for your agent to read, and your agent is instructed during setup to do the fixing itself. This is the part everyone finds out late: you never have to debug this stack yourself.
- **Update everything:** `./fullstack-agent/update.sh` on macOS. On Windows, ask your agent: "update everything and tell me what changed." Your files live outside the repos, so updates never touch who your agent is or what it remembers.
- **Daily habit:** open Claude Code in your agent's folder. That's where it lives.

## The fine print that matters

- The wizard never deletes, overwrites, or moves anything you built. Replacements retire the old thing in place and say so.
- Your vault stays wherever it already lives. Pieces connect by configuration paths, not by relocation.
- Requirements per piece: the voice needs a mic and about 1 GB of local models on first run; the hands need a webcam and Chrome; the mind and face need nothing but Python 3, which ships with macOS and most Linux distributions. **Windows ships none**, and the name `python` there is a Microsoft Store placeholder that passes a check and then exits without running, so the face and the hands each carry a `run.bat` that finds a working interpreter or says plainly that there is not one. Windows notes live in each piece's own README.
- Cross-piece problems: `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` here. Everything else: each piece's own guide.
